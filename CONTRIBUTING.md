Workflow
--------

Here's the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

* Fork the project.
* Clone down your fork ( `git clone git@github.com:[username]/benchmarking.git` ).
* Create a topic branch to contain your change ( `git checkout -b my_awesome_feature` ).
* Hack away.
* If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors.
* Push the branch up ( `git push origin my_awesome_feature` ).
* Create a pull request against jekyll/benchmarking and describe what your change
  does and the why you think it should be merged. Please be detailed.

Thanks! Benchmarking Jekyll should be (relatively) fun. If you find any of this hard to figure
out, let us know so we can improve our process or documentation!
